## Description

This project is a sample application that demonstrates how to create a RESTful API in Java using several popular technologies. It uses the Spring-Web framework to create REST endpoints, Swagger for API documentation, Spring-Data JPA for database interaction, H2 as an in-memory database, Maven for dependency management, Lombok to reduce code verbosity, Spring DevTools to facilitate development, and OpenFeign for integrating external services.

The application implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manipulate resources through the REST API. API documentation is automatically generated by Swagger, making it easier to understand and use the available endpoints. Additionally, a screenshot of the Swagger documentation is provided for quick viewing of the endpoints and their descriptions.

Overall, this project serves as a basic and practical model for starting the development of a Spring-based Java application, providing a solid framework and modern tools for building RESTful APIs.
